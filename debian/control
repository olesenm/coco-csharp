Description: Coco/R Compiler Generator (C-Sharp Version)
 Coco/R is a compiler generator, which takes an attributed grammar of a source
 language and generates a scanner and a parser for this language. The scanner
 works as a deterministic finite automaton. The parser uses recursive descent.
 LL(1) conflicts can be resolved by a multi-symbol lookahead or by semantic
 checks. Thus the class of accepted grammars is LL(k) for an arbitrary k.
 .
 Use the command 'coco-cs' to start Coco/R.
